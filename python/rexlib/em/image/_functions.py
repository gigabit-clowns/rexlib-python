"""Reading and writing image files, with the collaborators defaulted.

Wraps `rexlib._binding.em.image`: the same functions, but the format
manager and the reader provider default to ones over the default catalog
(see `rexlib.get_default_catalog`) and `read`'s `context` to the active
execution context, the way `rexlib.add` and its siblings take theirs. A
collaborator that takes a default comes after the arguments that do not.
